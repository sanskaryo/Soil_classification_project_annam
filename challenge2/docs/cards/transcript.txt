Approach to Solving the Problem:
To solve the soil image classification challenge, I adopted a hybrid deep learning and classical machine learning approach.

Started with a simple CNN model (64 filters, 10 epochs), but it only achieved ~0.6 F1-score, indicating a need for better feature extraction.

Switched to transfer learning using a pretrained ResNet18 (PyTorch) as a feature extractor to capture complex patterns efficiently.

Applied a Random Forest classifier on the extracted features for robustness and fast performance on small datasets.

Used 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Challenges Faced:

Limited Dataset: Small and imbalanced data made training deep models from scratch difficult.

Image Quality: Noisy/unclear images required heavy preprocessing.

Kaggle Inexperience: Initial difficulty navigating the platform.

Library Issues: Version mismatches and installation problems in the notebook.

Solo Workload: Handling preprocessing, modeling, tuning, and validation alone was time-consuming.

Solutions Implemented:

Leveraged ResNet18 via transfer learning to avoid overfitting.

Standardized image preprocessing with torchvision.transforms.

Switched from Keras to PyTorch for finer control and faster iteration.

Used multiple Jupyter Notebooks to test different setups.

Utilized Kaggle’s dual T4 GPUs to speed up training.

Managed dependencies carefully and reused modular code.

Results:
The ResNet18 + Random Forest hybrid achieved:

Avg CV F1-Score: 0.9446

Best Fold (Fold 5) F1-Score: 0.9705

Public LB Score: 1.000

Leaderboard Rank: 56

The model performed consistently across all soil types (Alluvial, Black, Clay, Red), balancing speed, accuracy, and interpretability—critical for small datasets and solo development.
